dagmatic
========

dagmatic is a tool to parse a custom ASCII-art representation of
Mercurial repositories and render them in a variety of forms (none
implemented yet, but SVG is the primary goal).

The input language looks like this::

   a-b-c
     \
      d-e

meaning:

  * a is the parent of b
  * b is the parent of c and d
  * d is the parent of e

History goes left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Currently there are only
two ways to express a parent-child relationship: horizontal (-) and
diagonal (\). This might change in future.

dagmatic also lets you express changeset obsolescence (ie.
precursor/successor relationships)::

  a-b-c
   \: :
    d-e

Here, d is the successor of b and e is the successor of c.
Obsolescence markers can only be vertical.

dagmatic will also let you describe a series of DAGs using a
transition marker::

  a-b

   || hg commit

  a-b-c


Usage
-----

Too early to document. See the source code.


TODO
----

  * use visitor pattern insteatd of tikz() method
  * use state pattern for parsing
